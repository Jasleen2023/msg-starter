# msg-starter

A static site starter kit.

*   [MSG](https://ijmccallum.github.io/Mini-Site-Generator/) to generate markup in a really _really_ flexible and simple way.
*   [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io) to bundle the JS in a concise and [performant](https://nolanlawson.com/2016/08/15/the-cost-of-small-modules/) manner.
*   [postcss](http://postcss.org/) to transpile super modern atomic ([tachyon like](http://tachyons.io/)) styles into cross-browser & mobile friendly CSS.

## Dev reccomendations

*   Install Prettier for your editor and set it up to format on save. It will also run when you commit, but it's a more enjoyable / less discombobulating experience to run on save.
*   Install ESLint for your editor. It hookes into the rules set for prettier, so not completely neccesarry but it sets up a more polished place for you to work in, lovely!

## TODOs

*   [ ] pa11y testing: follow links / take an array generated by another tool / test against local files
*   [ ] snapshot testing (https://www.cypress.io/ ?)
*   [ ] commit message linting
*   [ ] performance testing with pupateer, coverage budget, size budget
*   [ ] CI of some kind testing
*   [ ] Look into [prepack](https://prepack.io/) for improving js performance
*   [ ] https://codellama.io/ automated code review!?
